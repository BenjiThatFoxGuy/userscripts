## ![‚ö†Ô∏è](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/604447c0306b602acc59852a/1x.webp) Heads Up: Stuff Changes

These scripts might change at any time. Sites break, I fix (or break) things, and sometimes I add new features if I feel like it (especially for sites I use a lot). I make these for myself first, but if they help you, awesome.

I test everything, but there are no promises here except that I‚Äôm not shipping malware. (Still, check the code yourself!) I make these for myself, but I hope they help you too. If something breaks or you have an idea, open an issue and I‚Äôll see what I can do.

# ÔøΩ Nexus Mods: Auto-Click Slow Download (Because I Won't Pay)

Automatically clicks the "Slow Download" button for you on Nexus Mods. Because I'm not paying for a subscription just to skip a click. Sorry, not sorry.

---

## Features

- Waits a second, then clicks the slow download button for you
- No more hunting for the right button
- Works for free users, no interaction needed

---

## Install

- [Install Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenjiThatFoxGuy/userscripts/main/nexusmods.com/nexusmods.com.user.js)
- [View Metadata](https://updates.benjifox.gay/nexusmods.com.meta.js)

---

## Why?

Because your time is worth more than a forced subscription upsell. If Nexus changes their site (again), open an issue and I'll fix it if I can.
