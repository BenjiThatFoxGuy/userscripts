## ![‚ö†Ô∏è](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/604447c0306b602acc59852a/1x.webp) Heads Up: Stuff Changes

These scripts might change at any time. Sites break, I fix (or break) things, and sometimes I add new features if I feel like it (especially for sites I use a lot). I make these for myself first, but if they help you, awesome.

I test everything, but there are no promises here except that I‚Äôm not shipping malware. (Still, check the code yourself!) I make these for myself, but I hope they help you too. If something breaks or you have an idea, open an issue and I‚Äôll see what I can do.

# üîÅ Nitter Redirect: Twitter, But Not Awful

Sick of Twitter/X? This script auto-redirects every Twitter link to a working Nitter instance. No login, no tracking, no "please sign in to view". Just tweets, minus the Musk.

---

## Features

- Instantly rewires Twitter/X URLs to Nitter before the page even loads
- Picks a working Nitter instance for you (so you don't have to)
- No setup, no config, just install and forget

## Install

- [Install Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenjiThatFoxGuy/userscripts/main/nitter-redirect/nitter-redirect.user.js)

## Got Issues?

If Nitter is down (again), try another instance or open an issue. I can't fix the fediverse, but I can try to keep this script working.
