# ▶️ YouTube Watch Later: No Playlist Context

Removes `list=WL` from video links on your Watch Later playlist page so videos open individually, not as part of the playlist. This allows you to tick off videos one by one without being returned to the playlist context.


**Features:**

- Automatically cleans up all video links on the Watch Later playlist page.
- Removes `list=WL` and `index` parameters from video URLs.
- Ensures videos open solo, making it easier to mark them as watched.
- Works automatically as you browse or as new videos load.
