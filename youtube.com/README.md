## ![‚ö†Ô∏è](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/604447c0306b602acc59852a/1x.webp) Heads Up: Stuff Changes

These scripts might change at any time. Sites break, I fix (or break) things, and sometimes I add new features if I feel like it (especially for sites I use a lot). I make these for myself first, but if they help you, awesome.

I test everything, but there are no promises here except that I‚Äôm not shipping malware. (Still, check the code yourself!) I make these for myself, but I hope they help you too. If something breaks or you have an idea, open an issue and I‚Äôll see what I can do.

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube Watch Later: No Playlist Trap

Removes `list=WL` from video links on your Watch Later playlist page so videos open one by one, not as part of the playlist. Now you can actually watch stuff and tick it off without being shoved back into the playlist. Because YouTube wants you binging, but I want you free.

---

## Features

- Cleans up all video links on the Watch Later playlist page
- Removes `list=WL` and `index` from video URLs
- Makes sure videos open solo, so you can mark them as watched and move on
- Works automatically, even as new videos load

## Install

- [Install Script](https://updates.benjifox.gay/youtube.com.user.js)
- [View Metadata](https://updates.benjifox.gay/youtube.com.meta.js)

---

## Why?

Because I‚Äôm tired of being forced into a playlist rabbit hole. If YouTube changes things (again), open an issue and I‚Äôll patch it up.
