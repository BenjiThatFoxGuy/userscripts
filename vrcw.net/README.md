## ![‚ö†Ô∏è](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/604447c0306b602acc59852a/1x.webp) Heads Up: Stuff Changes

These scripts might change at any time. Sites break, I fix (or break) things, and sometimes I add new features if I feel like it (especially for sites I use a lot). I make these for myself first, but if they help you, awesome.

## ![ÔøΩÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/emotesv2_20c7bda61faa4e07b6a7d523d2bc9172/animated/light/1.0) No Guarantees (Except Not Malware)

I test everything, but there are no promises here except that I‚Äôm not shipping malware. (Still, check the code yourself!) I make these for myself, but I hope they help you too. If something breaks or you have an idea, open an issue and I‚Äôll see what I can do.

# üåê vrcw.net ‚Üí VRCX Deeplink: Less Clicking, More Exploring

Turns those ugly `wrld_` world IDs on vrcw.net into shiny, clickable VRCX deep links. No more copy-paste, no more "where's that world again?"‚Äîjust click and go.

---

## Features

- Converts world IDs to `vrcx://` links, everywhere on the page
- Works with both static and dynamically loaded content (because AJAX is everywhere now)
- Looks like it belongs there (no ugly buttons)

## Install

## Why?

Because VRChat world discovery shouldn't be a chore. If it breaks, open an issue and I'll poke at it when I can.
