# ![ü¶ä](https://cdn.benjifox.gay/favicon.ico) Benji's Userscripts Collection: Because the Internet Should Suck Less

Welcome to my pile of userscripts. These are little browser hacks I made because the web keeps getting worse and I got tired of clicking the same buttons, dodging trackers, or losing stuff to people's hissy fits turned impulsive actions that ruin searchability. If you want things to just work (or at least work a *teeny tiny* bit better), you're in the right place

- **[nitter-redirect](./nitter-redirect/):** Auto-redirects Twitter links to Nitter‚Äîno account, no tracking, no ID checks. Show a middle finger to Elon today and never touch Twitter again! UK Citizens rejoice!

- **[vrcw.net](./vrcw.net/):** Turns VRCW world IDs into VRCX deep links to make it easier to visit some lesser known worlds. Saves you a few clicks and opening a new tab. I'd say it's worth it

- **[nexusmods.com](./nexusmods.com/):** Auto-clicks the Slow Download button to save you clicks. Fuck you Nexus, I won't pay for a subscription to download content your users contributed

- **[e621.net](./e621.net/):** Brings back deleted posts. Thank your local datahoarder today. Image only for now sadly - blame e6's restrictive CORS. Hurr durr e621 bad my ass

- **[youtube.com](./youtube.com/):** Lets you actually watch stuff from your Watch Later list without being shoved into a playlist binging rabbit hole. Fuck you YouTube‚ÄîI'm here to watch something not to keep watching
- **[twitchemotes.com](./twitchemotes.com/):** Unblocks right-click on emote and badge images. If they'd just give us a "don't show again" option, we wouldn't need this‚Äîjust respect the owners. Popup begone!

Each folder has its own README with install links, features, and the nitty gritty.

## ![‚ö†Ô∏è](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/604447c0306b602acc59852a/1x.webp) Heads Up: Stuff Changes 

These scripts might change at any time. Sites break, I fix (or break) things, and sometimes I add new features if I feel like it (especially for sites I use a lot‚ÄîYouTube will probably get more tweaks, for example). I make these for myself first, but if they help you, awesome

I test everything, but there are no promises here except that I‚Äôm not shipping malware. (Still, check the code yourself!) I make these for myself, but I hope they help you too. If something breaks or you have an idea, open an issue and I‚Äôll see what I can do.

## ![ü§î](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/5b3409ece50b09705d1c7da1/1x.webp) How Do I Use This?


1. Get a userscript manager (Violentmonkey, Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, whatever‚Äîif you don‚Äôt have one, how?)
2. Go to the folder for the script you want. Click the install link. Your browser will probably ask if you‚Äôre sure. Say yes.
3. That‚Äôs it. Enjoy a *slightly* less terrible web.

## Updates & Mirrors

Scripts update from my r2 bucket @ [updates.benjifox.gay](https://updates.benjifox.gay) - if your userscript manager supports updates that is. If that‚Äôs down, I have a plan B and plan C. I try to keep things working even if the internet is on fire
