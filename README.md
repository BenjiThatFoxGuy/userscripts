## 🌍 Custom Update URLs

All userscripts in this repository use a custom update metadata URL hosted at **[updates.benjifox.gay](https://updates.benjifox.gay)** for reliable updates. If this server is unavailable, a fallback **GitHub Gist** mirror is used where applicable. This helps maintain functionality even during outages.
