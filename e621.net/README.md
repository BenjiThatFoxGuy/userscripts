## ![‚ö†Ô∏è](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/604447c0306b602acc59852a/1x.webp) Heads Up: Stuff Changes

These scripts might change at any time. Sites break, I fix (or break) things, and sometimes I add new features if I feel like it (especially for sites I use a lot). I make these for myself first, but if they help you, awesome.

I test everything, but there are no promises here except that I‚Äôm not shipping malware. (Still, check the code yourself!) I make these for myself, but I hope they help you too. If something breaks or you have an idea, open an issue and I‚Äôll see what I can do.

# ü¶¶ e621 Deleted Post Restorer: Because Datahoarders Never Die

Restores deleted e621/e926 posts by poking the same distributed archive network that powers [e6DPRT](https://e6dprt.benjifox.gay/). If a post is gone but the archive has it, you get the image back‚Äîno more "sorry, deleted" nonsense.

---

## Features

- Detects deleted posts on e621 and e926
- Rebuilds the archive path and fetches the image (if it exists)
- Embeds the image using a data URL to dodge CORS/CSP
- Gives you a download button for the recovered image
- Powered by the same network as [e6DPRT](https://e6dprt.benjifox.gay/)

## Install

- [Install Script](https://updates.benjifox.gay/e621.net.user.js)
- [View Metadata](https://updates.benjifox.gay/e621.net.meta.js)

## Notes

Image only for now‚Äîblame e621's restrictive CORS. If it breaks, yell at me on GitHub or check the main repo for updates.
