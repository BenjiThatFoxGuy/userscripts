# ðŸ¦¦ e621 Deleted Post Restorer

Restores deleted e621/e926 posts by checking the same distributed archive network that powers [e621 Deleted Post Recovery Tool (e6DPRT)](https://e6dprt.benjifox.gay/). If a post is deleted but present in the archive, the script will display the image and provide a download button, bypassing e621/e926's restrictions.

**Features:**
- Detects deleted posts on e621 and e926.
- Retrieves post metadata and reconstructs the archive path.
- Embeds the image using a data URL to bypass CSP/CORS.
- Provides a download button for the recovered image.
- Powered by the same network as [e6DPRT](https://e6dprt.benjifox.gay/).
