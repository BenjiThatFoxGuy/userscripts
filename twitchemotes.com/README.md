# twitchemotes.com - Unblock Right Click on Images

## ![‚ö†Ô∏è](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/604447c0306b602acc59852a/1x.webp) Heads Up: Stuff Changes

These scripts might change at any time. Sites break, I fix (or break) things, and sometimes I add new features if I feel like it (especially for sites I use a lot). I make these for myself first, but if they help you, awesome.

I test everything, but there are no promises here except that I‚Äôm not shipping malware. (Still, check the code yourself!) I make these for myself, but I hope they help you too. If something breaks or you have an idea, open an issue and I‚Äôll see what I can do.
